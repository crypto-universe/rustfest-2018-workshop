# Welcome to the RustFest 2018 libp2p workshop!

The purpose of this workshop will be to write a simple peer-to-peer chat application using the
`libp2p` library. This library relies on `futures` and `tokio`, and will also demonstrate the usage
of these libraries.

[Libp2p](https://libp2p.io) is a peer-to-peer protocol started by protocol labs. It is designed to
be modular and generic.

## Steps

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/tomaka/rustfest-2018-workshop`.
- Read `chapter-1/src/main.rs` to start with the first task.
- Once done, go to `chapter-2/src/main.rs`.
- Once done, go to `chapter-3/src/main.rs`.

Remember that you can run `cargo doc` in order to generate the documentation of all the
dependencies used by a package.
